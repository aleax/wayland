wayland (0.85.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Wayland/Weston aren't quite ready to replace Xorg yet, but let's
    upload those to unstable anyway, so that people can find out by
    themselves. On the plus side, mesa can stop getting wayland support
    enabled in experimental, then disabled back when uploaded to unstable.
  * Update long description, wayland-demos got replaced by weston.

  * First upstream release:
    - http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.wayland.devel/1770
  * Update watch file, even if that's only useful for notifications:
    upstream releases xz tarballs, and the 1.0 source format only suports
    gz.
